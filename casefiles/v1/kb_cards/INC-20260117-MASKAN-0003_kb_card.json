  "content": "Intercompany payment TXN-GRP-0098 to Maskan Trading FZE for USD 175,000 submitted at 11:30 UTC on 2026-01-17. Sanctions screening returned ESCALATE with 75% match confidence due to fuzzy match against 'BANK MASKAN' (OFAC UID 4633, programs IRAN, IRAN-EO13902). Search score 6.2 triggered FUZZY_MEDIUM classification per compliance_sanctions_escalation.md Section 3.1. Payment placed on immediate HOLD per runbook_emergency_payment.md Section 7. Liquidity assessment showed no buffer concerns - USD position healthy with headroom of USD 1,200,000. Case escalated to Compliance Analyst queue at 11:35 UTC. Compliance review completed at 13:20 UTC: beneficiary is 'Maskan Trading FZE', a UAE Free Zone entity established in 2019, with UAE commercial license and distinct ownership structure. No connection to Iranian banking sector. Compliance Manager approved false positive determination at 13:45 UTC. MLRO final clearance granted at 14:45 UTC with documented rationale citing: different jurisdiction (UAE vs Iran), different entity type (trading company vs bank), different ownership (private vs state-affiliated). Payment released at 14:48 UTC before 16:00 cutoff. Enhanced audit bundle includes full case package, KYC verification, and MLRO clearance memo."
